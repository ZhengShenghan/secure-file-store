# secure-file-store
CS 161 project 2 (Spring 2017)

Project 2-1 (A simple, but secure client):

Simple Upload/Download: Implemented a file store with a secure (but possibly inefficient) upload/download interface.

Project 2-2 (Sharing and Revocation):

Sharing: Implemented sharing() and receive_sharing() which allows for sharing of files but with different names for each person.

Revocation: Implemented remote revoking of user's access to a file and the people that the user shared a file to until the end.

Project 2-3 (Efficient Updates):

Efficient Updates: Designed and implemented a solution for efficiently updating files that are already stored on the server. It can efficiently handle very large files (potentially multiple gigabytes long) but maintains confidentiality and integrity of the files.
